## EDA and ML on SG's HDB resale prices in 2017
Typically, young Singaporean couples can choose to purchase Build-To-Order(BTO) or resale HDB flats. However, as BTO is acquired through a bidding system and the competition is stiff, I am more inclined towards purchasing a resale flat. Henceforth, I want to find out what are the factors affecting the prices of resale flats and thereafter, attempt to build a Linear Regression Model to predict the price based on several factors.

### 1) HDB dataset
CSV file is taken from Singapore public data (Data.gov.sg). 

### 2) Data Visualisation
I use python matplotlib and seaborn to come out with interesting and beautiful visualisation about the trend of resale HDB prices in Singapore.
